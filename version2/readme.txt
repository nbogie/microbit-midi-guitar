- sort out switch bounce on tone:bit and art:bit.
It is causing significant problems with chord mode now.
We have seen lots of stuttering notes in the piano roll in
Garage Band that proves this is happening.

A quick fix would be use P1 or P2 on the art:bit for the
pluck pad, as they already have debounce on them.
Will have to adjust wiring of guitar to make this work,
but it could be a really quick fix for pluck at least.


- decide on octave positions based on strings
(might make it more like a guitar)
